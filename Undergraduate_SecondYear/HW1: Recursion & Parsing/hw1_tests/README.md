# CSCI 104 - HW # 1 Tests

 - The three folders contain the test files which were used to grade problems 5, 6, and 7 of HW # 1.

 - File names containing the word `input` are the actual tests. For problem 7, the contents of `input` files could either be entered on the command line, or re-directed using a `<` operator.

 - File names containing the word `solution` are the expected solutions.

 - One would run these tests and store program output in an `output` file. A comparison with the solution files and output files should then be performed.
