This is the readme file for homework assignment 1.
There are 6 files in this folder (Excluding README.md):

hw1.txt: This text file contains my answers to questions 1-4

sequencesearch.cpp: This file contains a program that solves the following problem: You will be given a "grid" of floating point numbers (double), and are to look for the longest strictly increasing sequence along a row or column, forward or backward (but no diagonals). The grid need not be regular. The program outputs a file with a number that indicates the longest sequence.


parsemd.cpp: This file contains a program that reads the name of a Markdown text file at the command line, and outputs into a file, one per line, each word in the file in the order in which they appear. It does not output any special characters, numbers, white space, etc.


palindrome.cpp: This file contains a program that will read in a string of characters and an integer size and generate all possible palindromes of the given size or less using the characters provided as options. Each palindrome should be output to a file.

Under the folder named test|input files, there are the following files:

input_P5.txt: This file contains the grid provided on the HW1 webpage as an input for problem 5's sequencesearch

input_P6.txt: This file contains the sample input provided on the hw1 webpage as an input for problem 6's parsemd.cpp
