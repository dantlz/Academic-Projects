This is the readme file for homework assignment 2.
The hw2 folder contains 8 files, excluding this README.md file. They are as follows:

hw2.txt: This text file contains my answers to questions 1-4

split.cpp (Problem 5): This file contains a a recursive function that splits the elements of a singly-linked list into two sublists, one containing the elements less than or equal to a given number, the other containing the elements larger than the number. At the same time, the original list is not preserved.

split_mainFunction.cpp: This file contains tests for split.cpp. To use this file, copy and paste all of its content into split.cpp and compile split.cpp

llistint.h and llistint.cpp (Problem 6): These files contain the implementation of a doubly-linked list, specifically, with the methods insert, remove, and getNodeAt completed.

llistint_test.cpp: This file contains tests for llistint.h and llistint.cpp

setCheck.cpp (Problem 7): This file contains a program that reads a text file, and then lets a user query interactively to test if certain words are in the file. Specifically, it reads a text file (whose name is given at the command line) that consists of arbitrary characters. Words consist only of letters (upper case or lower case); anything else separates words.

setCheck_input.cpp: This file contains a test input file for setCheck.cpp
