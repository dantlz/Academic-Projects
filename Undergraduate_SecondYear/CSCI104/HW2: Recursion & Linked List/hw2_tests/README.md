# CSCI 104 - HW # 2 Tests

 - The three folders contain the test files which were used to grade problems 5, 6, and 7 of HW # 2.

#### Problem 5
  - A Google test is provided that was used for the grading. Replace [line 4](https://github.com/usc-csci104-fall2015/homework-resources/blob/master/hw2_tests/Problem5_tests/gtest_llistint_rec.cpp#L4) with the `.cpp` file containing your `split( )` function. 

  - Your `.cpp` file should only contain the `split( )`function and the definition for the Node. Comment out any other code including the `main( )` function (except maybe #include <iostream>). 

  - If you have not defined the struct in the `.cpp` file, copy it from the top of the Google Test file to your file for the Node definition.

#### Problem 6
 In the provided Google test, replace [line 4](https://github.com/usc-csci104-fall2015/homework-resources/blob/master/hw2_tests/Problem6_tests/gtest_llistint.cpp#L4) with your `.h` filename.

#### Problem 7
 The `input` text files should be used as the command line argument for the excutable. File names containing the word `commands` contain the search terms, while `solution` files have the expected solutions.
