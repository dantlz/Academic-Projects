This is the readme file for homework assignment 7.
The files in the hw7 folder are as follows:

**bst.h**: This file contains the binary search tree implementation

**graphColoring.cpp**: This file contains a program that 4-colors a map using recursion and backtracking. The input file (whose name will be passed at the command line) will have three parameters on the first line: how many "countries" there are in the map, the number of rows in the map, and the number of columns in the map. The map will never be bigger than 80 by 80 characters, and will contain at most 15 countries. 

**input.txt**: This file is a sample textfile for graphColoring.cpp.

**makefile**: This file is the make file. To compile graphColoring.cpp, simply enter:

>make

To run graphColoring.cpp with input file being *input.txt*(replace this with your file), enter:

>./bin/graphColoring input.txt

To clean up, enter:

>make clean

**out.txt**: This file is the hard-coded output file for graphColoring.cpp

**rbbst.h**: This file contains the implementation of the red black binary search tree.

**rbbst_test.cpp**: This file contains a test for rbbst.h. To compile it, enter:

>make rbbst_test

To run it, enter:

>bin/rbbst_test

To clean up, enter:

>make clean

**README.md**: This is the readme file you're currently reading.

**red_black_tree.pdf**: This PDF file contains the red black tree insertion result for problem 1.
